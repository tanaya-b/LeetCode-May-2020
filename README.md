LeetCode's May Challenge of solving a problem a day

##Approach
I have perceived the problem as a Search Technique Use Case.
A binary search tree does not store an index of its data elements. Instead, it relies on its implicit structure (left or right of each node) to keep a record of where each element is. The result is insertion and deletion at logarithmic time, or O(log n).
Therefore, I have used Binary Tree to resolve the problem.

This Approach has not provided optimal runtime(32ms)/memory usage(13.7MB).
